# vcli
A remote command line interface for [HashiCorp's Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) written in bash using as many builtin commands as possible

# Why vcli
**vcli**'s purpose is to ease the management of secrets when developing applications that make use of Vault.
As every bash script that's grown beyond it's purpose, **vcli** started with a simple 'for' statement to ease the browse of a [HashiCorp's Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) server. It continued as a challenge of what can be achieved simply using bash with its 4.x version powerful features.
Now it has become a useful tool here at [Stratio](http://www.stratio.com)
